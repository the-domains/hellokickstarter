  The first project I backed this past year was Goetia by Square-Enix. Itâ€™s a
  point & click mystery adventure for Mac & PC. It had the big name publisher
  behind it and the art style was intriguing. Over 1,000 people agreed and the
  game was delivered on-time and is currently available to purchase on Steam.
