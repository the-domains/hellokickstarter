# Hello, Kickstarter

## My Annual Kickstarter Reward Breakdown

Every year I break down the Kickstarters I back and ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/de201622-77bc-4754-bf27-b39149d39e78.png)

The first project I backed this past year was [Goetia][0] by Square-Enix. It's a point & click mystery adventure for Mac & PC. It had the big name publisher behind it and the art style was intriguing. Over 1,000 people agreed and the game was delivered on-time and is currently available to purchase on [Steam][1].
![Bring Your Own Book, the game of borrowed phrases](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a876a06-552a-40ea-b601-231565f3ff63.png)

Bring Your Own Book was a game I saw demoed at PAX South in 2015\. It consists of a series of cards that say things like "Something your grandmother would say," or "name for a candy bar." You have 60 seconds to scour any random book you have on hand to find a phrase that matches the clue on the card. It's a terrific party game and is currently available to [purchase online][2].
